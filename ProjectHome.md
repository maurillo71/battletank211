This project is a game very similar to Robocode where users submit tank programs to participate in arena battles. The language is C++. The project aims to illustrate to programming students and enthusiasts the use of several different C/C++ concepts in a fun and engaging context.

The game will use OpenGL and will initially be designed for Windows, but there might be some porting effort done.
